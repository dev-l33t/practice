# Test Plan for Practice

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the test plan for the practice an application. The purpose is to verify that the software meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Objectives
- Validate functional correctness of all features
- Ensure the application is user-friendly and stable
- Detect and report bugs before release

## 3. Scope
- Functional testing of Login, Registration, User Dashboard, and UI components  
- Basic performance and usability testing  
- Manual testing with some automation planned for regression

## 4. Test Items
- User Login Module  
- User Registration Module  
- User Interface (UI)  
- Error Handling and Validations

## 5. Testing Types
- Manual Functional Testing  
- Regression Testing  
- UI Testing  
- Boundary Value Testing

## 6. Testing Approach
- Test cases will be executed based on requirements  
- Defect reporting and tracking through [Bug Tracking Tool]  
- Re-testing and regression after fixes

## 7. Resources
- Testing Team: 1 QA Intern (You)  
- Tools: Jira (Bug Tracking), Postman (API Testing), Selenium (Automation - planned)

## 8. Environment
- OS: Windows 10 / macOS  
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge  
- Test Data: Dummy user accounts and inputs

## 9. Deliverables
- Test Cases Document  
- Test Summary Report  
- Bug Reports
