# ✅ What is a Traceability Matrix?

A **Traceability Matrix** is a document (often structured as a table) that maps and links project **requirements** to their corresponding **test cases**. It ensures:

- ✅ Every requirement is covered by one or more test cases.
- ✅ Testing coverage is visible and traceable.
- ✅ Missing or duplicate test coverage can be detected.
- ✅ Helps in **impact analysis** — when a requirement changes, it’s easy to identify which test cases are affected.

# 🧪 Why is it Important?

The Traceability Matrix plays a critical role in the software testing lifecycle:

- 🔍 **Ensures 100% functional coverage** of defined requirements.
- 📋 **Supports review meetings** by demonstrating test mapping.
- 🛡️ **Satisfies audit or compliance requirements** for traceability.
- 🔄 Helps in **regression testing** — easy to identify impacted areas.
- 👥 Acts as a communication bridge between **Business Analysts, Developers, and QA teams**.

---

# 📌 Example Use Cases

- A change request is raised → use the matrix to quickly find which test cases need to be updated.
- A failed test is found → use the matrix to trace it back to the original business requirement.
- During UAT or audits → provide the matrix to show what has been tested and validated.

> 🔧 **Tip:** In real-time projects, traceability matrices are often generated using tools like **Jira**, **TestRail**, or even Excel.
